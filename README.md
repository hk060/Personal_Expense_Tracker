# Personal Expense Tracker

This is a simple **Personal Expense Tracker** built in Python with Jupyter Notebook.  
It allows you to:

- Add expenses (date, category, amount, description)
- View recent entries
- Get **weekly and monthly summaries**
- See **visualizations** (bar chart for weekly, pie chart for monthly)
- Store data in a simple CSV file (`expenses.csv`)
